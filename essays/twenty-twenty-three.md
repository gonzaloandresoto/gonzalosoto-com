it's december 22, 1:30 am. i just finished watching the wolverine and i'm sipping some peppermint tea looking for the inspiration to write this reflection. you see, 2023 wasn't like most years. i think i'm just beginning to accept that. so, while i may not have a coherent way of phrasing these thoughts as of now, i figured i'd just start writing and see where it goes.

the following reflections are raw and unfiltered. think of it like a stream of conciousness being typed on abs plastic.

## letting go and holding on
for the longest time, i abided to a very strict regimen. carefully calculated, everything with intent. it kept me going through some of the hardest periods of my life. periods where i dealt with uncertainty, loss, and disillusionment. regimen gave me structure, purpose, and a feeling of safety. but, regimen also enabled me to surrender other aspects of myself.

spontaneity, passion, emotion

2022 was pivotal in this sense. over the course of the year, i learned to once again embrace the unpredictabilities in life. the summer spent travelling across south-east asia, the late night drives, the last minute plans.

it was truly special.

2023 followed in the same manner, i got to live with one of my closest friends in vancouver, travelled to japan, booked a one-way ticket to portugal to work remotely, visited various cities across europe and africa, met a ton of wonderful people, and experienced many of the things i once dreamed of.

it felt magical.

but to be completely frank, i'm exhausted. not physically, but mentally. i spent all year in constant movement. from airbnb to airbnb, from airport to airport.

blurry moments, losing their uniqueness, passing me by

at times, it feels as if i experience this year's memories in third person

and so, i sit here with a new vision for the future. a life where there's enough room for both the black and white moments of life. a life filled with grey moments, surrounded by those i love most.

today, i let go of my relentless pursuit.
