It's approximately a month after the Canadian Undergraduate Conference on AI (CUCAI) hosted 335 delegates from all across Canada for a weekend of keynotes, workshops, and our flagship research showcase. Being the culmination of over a year's planning, CUCAI continued to underscore the lack of opportunities available for driven technical talent to gain exposure for their work.

Unlike hackathons and case competitions, AI research has no landmark event for undergrads – something I've always found puzzling.

CUCAI's story began in 2019, at the hands of fellow Queen's University alum. Since then, the conference has come to host the likes of Geoffrey Hinton, Shivon Zillis, Ivan Zhang, and many other highly respected individuals within the AI space. It's been sponsored by the largest companies in the industry and has amassed over 1000+ delegates through the years.

## Optimism
While CUCAI had experienced many successes, I became the conference Chair after its worst-performing event – COVID had made it difficult to execute the conference's flagship showcase, the portion of the weekend which drew the most enthusiasm. Worst of all, the conference had lost the entirety of its funding after contractual obligations weren't met with event partners.

This was one of the hardest moments I've been through as a leader. I had just hired my team and had spent the entire time prior to this thinking of all the creative ways in which we could leverage our funding and industry reputation to piece together an equivalent to Hack The North or Tree Hacks (yes, it was a big goal, but i was optimistic).

## Turbulence
For conciseness and discretion, I'll fast forward a few months, after which, thanks to the help of many kind souls, we were certain the conference would be allowed to happen again. By this point, we were well behind our original fundraising timeline and I had another 200+ person weekend to execute in a few weeks. To make matters more complicated, I had also started working full-time as a Product Manager a Blossom Social, all while still maintaining a course load.

I relied heavily on my team during this period, and decided to divide the remaining months leading to the conference into three segments:
- finalize important details (where, when, what)
- attain funding (how)
- build hype (why – should anybody care?)
