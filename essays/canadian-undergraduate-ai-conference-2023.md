It's approximately a month after the Canadian Undergraduate Conference on AI (CUCAI) hosted 335 delegates from all across Canada for a weekend of keynotes, workshops, and our flagship research showcase. Being the culmination of over a year's planning, CUCAI continued to underscore the lack of opportunities available for driven technical talent to gain exposure for their work.

Unlike hackathons and case competitions, AI research has no landmark event for undergrads – something I've always found puzzling.

CUCAI's story began in 2019, at the hands of fellow Queen's University alum. Since then, the conference has come to host the likes of Geoffrey Hinton, Shivon Zillis, Ivan Zhang, and many other highly respected individuals within the AI space. It's been sponsored by the largest companies in the industry and has amassed over 1000+ delegates through the years.

## Optimism

While CUCAI had experienced many successes, I became the conference Chair after its worst-performing event – COVID had made it difficult to execute the conference's flagship showcase, the portion of the weekend which drew the most enthusiasm. Worst of all, the conference had lost the entirety of its funding after contractual obligations weren't met with event partners. I was blindsided.

This was one of the hardest moments I've been through as a leader. I had just hired my team and had spent the entire time prior to this thinking of all the creative ways in which we could leverage our funding and industry reputation to piece together an equivalent to Hack The North or Tree Hacks (yes, it was a big goal, but I was optimistic).

## Turbulence

For conciseness and discretion, I'll fast forward a few months, after which, thanks to the help of many kind souls, we were certain the conference would be allowed to happen again. By this point, we were well behind our original fundraising timeline and I had another 200+ person weekend to execute in a few weeks. To complicate matters, I had also started working full-time as a Product Manager at Blossom Social, all while still maintaining a course load.

I relied heavily on my team during this period, and decided to divide the remaining months leading to the conference into three segments:

- Finalize important details (where, when, what, who)
- Attain funding (how)
- Build hype (why – should anybody care?)

## Funding

Fundraising for an undergraduate conference in 2022 and 2023 posed many unique challenges. Primarily, mass-scale layoffs plagued the tech industry, and the majority of our previous sponsors were unable to provide any sort of funding or support.

"We would love to be involved, it's just hard to justify any contribution with everything going on right now. Best of luck."

By this point in time, we weren't even phased by the added roadblock. We knew we had to be creative, and we knew we were going to execute one way or another. After some rethinking and careful budget planning, we realized that the majority of the conference expenses could be covered by ticket sales. We just had to sell enough of them, and they wouldn't be as accessible as we'd originally planned them to be.

This, however, was in direct contradiction to one of the core values of the conference, so we decided we'd find a way around it. The solution would be to collaborate directly with other Universities to subsidize the attendance costs for their students. Thankfully, by this point in time, various other organizations such as Wat.ai (University of Waterloo) and Western AI (Western University), etc had agreed to help us in this endeavour.

While uncertain, we at least had a path to follow, and one that would make it feasible to host as many students as possible, free of charge.

## Scrapiness

The start of 2023 marked the dawn of a new year and a positive turn for CUCAI. Our relentlessness began to finally pay off, with sponsorship outreach efforts generating leads, and speakers beginning to confirm their attendance. Still, we remained scrappy, Messaging founders through their company Discords, using sponsorship interest from one company to leverage buy-in from others, and getting rate-limited by LinkedIn for mass-messaging connections.

In the span of a few weeks we went from having no money, no speakers, and no venue, to a packed itinerary, filled with multiple special guests, sessions, and $XX,000 in funding.

Consistencty mattered.

## A Blur

From that point forward, the entirety of the event flashed before our eyes. There were various fires to put out, last minute cancellations, and a storm that covered the highways with 13 inches of snow. Nevertheless, we had close to 100% attendance, and felt nothing but content over the whole weekend.

I can't be more thankful of the CUCAI 2023 team. Without everyone's commitment to the mission, nothing would have been possible.

## No Other Way

I felt many emotions during my time as a conference Chair, feelings that I'll never get to relive again. I learned that nothing's ever really over until you stop fighting for it, and that when the world asks for lemonade and there's no lemons around, you can make do with limes.
