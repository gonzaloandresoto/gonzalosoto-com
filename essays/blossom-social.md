## Overview

Blossom is a Canadian venture-backed startup with $1.5M in funding. Together, we were building an all-in-one investing experience to help retail investors build generational wealth through:

- A supportive community
- Bite-sized educational video modules
- Visual portfolio insights and analytics.

I joined Blossom when it had under 500 users, leading product strategy and execution until we reached 55,000.

During this time, I played a critical role in reshaping the company's initial mission, from becoming a major player in the Canadian investment space to facilitating the global beginner investor experience.

Blossom was often praised for our ability to rapidly ship high-quality updates to our core product lines, as well as our ability to build community by engaging and talking to users.

Working at Blossom gave me a unique perspective on product & design. In previous product oriented roles, my decision making primarily relied on quantitative insights, whether derived from internal metrics, or user research. However, being that Blossom was so early in its development:

- We didn't have many insights as the app was very incomplete
- Our user-base was not representative of our target demographic

As such, I was forced to adopt a qualitative lens, adding a new dimension to my building approach.
